<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 lb of zucchini (about 3 medium sized), coarsely grated</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
<li>3 green onions, minced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme</li>
<li>1 teaspoon minced fresh basil</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 cup of olive oil, grapeseed oil, or canola oil</li>
<li>1/2 cup sour cream (can sub Greek yogurt)</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, minced, about 1 teaspoon</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
<li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Salt the grated zucchini with about 1 teaspoon of salt. Place in a sieve or colander over a bowl. Let sit for 10 minutes. Press down with a wooden spoon to push out more of the water. Wrap in paper towels and try to squeeze out more liquid.</li>
    
<li>While the zucchini is releasing its liquid in step one, make the dipping sauce. Whisk together the sour cream, minced garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt into a medium bowl and set aside.</li>

<li>Whisk egg in a large bowl. Add the grated zucchini, flour, minced green onions, thyme, basil, lemon zest, salt and pepper. Mix to combine well.</li>

<li>Heat oil in a large skillet (we recommend a 10-inch cast iron skillet) over medium high heat until the oil is shimmery and hot. Test the oil by flicking a little flour into it. If the flour sizzles it's ready. Cook the fritters in batches. Drop heaping tablespoons of batter into the skillet. Flatten slightly with the back end of a spoon or spatula. Cook, turning once, until browned, 4-6 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>

<li>Serve immediately, with sour cream dipping sauce.
Fritters can be reheated by placing on a sheet pan under a broiler for a minute or two.</li>
